<h2>🌐 Functionality Improvements & New Features</h2>
<p>
    We’ve also introduced several powerful new features aimed at making QuerySafe more flexible and globally accessible:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-language support (in progress):</strong> While currently optimized for English, support for other languages is under development to allow multilingual chatbot conversations.</li>
    <li><strong>Session Memory Introduction:</strong> Your chatbot now retains context across conversation threads, resulting in more natural and continuous dialogue flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Upcoming support for document version tracking and role-based access control.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>📈 Why These Upgrades Matter</h2>
<p>
    Every improvement we make is aimed at one thing: helping you build smarter, faster, and more effective chatbots without any technical complexity. From UI smoothness to backend speed, from multilingual support to conversation continuity — we are evolving to meet your needs.
