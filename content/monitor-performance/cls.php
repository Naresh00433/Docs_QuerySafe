<h2>5. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong> CLS measures the visual stability of your chatbot UI during load and interaction.
</p>
<p>
    If buttons, chat windows, or elements move unexpectedly, it increases CLS.
</p>
<p>
    A low CLS ensures your chatbot has a stable, professional interface with no annoying UI jumps.
